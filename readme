Description
First we normalize all the data, then split the brain 17 times along all three dimensions.
The feature selection process compares the distance between the means of both classes to
the sum of the standard deviations, therefore prefering features that separate the data.
To classify, we use sklearn's RandomForestClassifier tuned by exhaustive grid search
with crossval on 17 bins.
We use Matlab for feature extraction/selection (run processing.m) to reuse code from MLP1
and Python for classification (tuning.py, then predict_final.py)
